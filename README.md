# BoDeGHa 
_(previously BoDeGa)_

An automated tool to identify bots in GitHub repositories by analysing pull request and issue comments. 
The tool has been developed by Mehdi Golzadeh, researcher at the [Software Engineering Lab](http://informatique.umons.ac.be/genlog/) of the [University of Mons](https://www.umons.ac.be) (Belgium) as part of his PhD research in the context of the [SECO-ASSIST Excellence of Science research project](https://secoassist.github.io).

The tool accepts the name of a GitHub repository and requires a GitHub API key to compute its output in three steps.
The first step consists of downloading all pull request comments and issue comments from the specified repository using the GitHub GraphQL API. This step results in a list of commenters and their corresponding pull request and issue comments.
The second step consists of computing the following features that are needed for the classification model: the number of comments, empty comments, comment patterns, and inequality between the number of comments within patterns.
The third step applies the classification model on the repository data and outputs the bot prediction made by the classification model.

**Note about misclassifications** The tool is based on a classification model that has been validated on a [ground-truth dataset](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4000387), and cannot reach a precision and recall of 100%. The accuracy may differ from one project to another, depending on the amount and types of accounts and comments. When running the tool on a GitHub repository of your choice, it is therefore possible that the tool may produce misclassifications in practice (humans misclassified as bots, or vice versa). For more details we refer to the association research publication. If you would encounter such situations while running the tool, please inform us about it, so that we can strive to further improve the accurracy of the classification algorithm. A known reason for the presence of misclassifations is the use of templates in pull request and issue comments by human commenters.
Since the classification model's performance has been validated on accounts containing between 10 and 100 comments, the default parameters of the tool have been set to 10 for *--min-comments* and 100 for *--max-comments*. One can run the tool with other values on its own risk, without any guarantees on the accuracy.


## Publication
This tool is a part of an empirical research endeavour aiming to identify bots in GitHub. A preprint of the research article, published in the Journal on Systems and Software, is available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03303). To cite this article, please use the following citation:

## Installation
To install BoDeGHa, run the following command:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/mehdigolzadeh/BoDeGHa
```
Given that this tool has many dependencies, and in order not to conflict with already installed packages, it is recommended to use a virtual environment before its installation. You can install and create a _Python virtual environment_ and then install and run the tool in this environment. You can use any virtual environment of your choice. Below are the steps to install and create a virtual environment with **virtualenv**.

Use the following command to install the virtual environment:
```
pip install virtualenv
```
Create a virtual environment in the folder where you want to place your files:
```
virtualenv <name>
```
Start using the environment by:
```
source <name>/bin/activate
```
After running this command your command line prompt will change to `(<name>) ...` and now you can install BoDeGHa with the pip command.
When you are finished running the tool, you can quit the environment by:
```
deactivate
```


## Usage 
To run *BoDeGHa* you need to provide a *GitHub personal access token* (API key). You can follow the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) to obtain such a token (**You don't need any of permissions in the list**).

You can execute the tool with all default parameters by running `bodegha repo_owner\repo_name --key <token>`

Here is the list of parameters:

`--accounts [ACCOUNT [ACCOUNT ...]]` 	**User login of one or more accounts**
> Example: $ bodegha repo_owner/repo_name --accounts mehdigolzadeh alexandredecan tommens --key <token>
  
_By default all accounts in the repository will be analysed_

`--start-date START_DATE` 		**Start date of pull request and issue comments in the repository to be considered**
> Example: $ bodegha repo_owner/repo_name --start-date 01-01-2018 --key <token>
  
_The default start-date is 6 months before the current date. 

`--verbose` **To have verbose output result**
> Example: $ bodegha repo_owner/repo_name --verbose --key <token>

_The default value is false, if you don't pass this parameter the output will only be the accounts and their type_
  
`--min-comments MIN_COMMENTS` 		**Minimum number of pull request and issue comments that are required to analyze an account**
> Example: $ bodegha repo_owner/repo_name --min-comments 20 --key <token>
 
_The default value is 10 comments (the reason explained earlier in this file)_

`--max-comments MAX_COMMENTS` 		**Maximum number of pull request and issue comments to be considered for each account (default=100)**
> Example: $ bodegha repo_owner/repo_name --max-comments 120 --key <token>

_The default value is 100 comments (the reason explained earlier in this file)_

`--key APIKEY` 				**GitHub personal access token required to download comments from GitHub GraphQL API**
_This parameter is mandatory and you can obtain an access token as described earlier_

`--text`                	Output results as plain text
`--csv`                		Output results in comma-separated values (csv) format
`--json`                	Output results in json format
> Example: $ bodegha repo_owner/repo_name --json --key <token> 

_This group of parameters is the type of output, e.g., if you pass --json you will get the result in JSON format_

`--exclude [ACCOUNT [ACCOUNT ...]]` **List of accounts to be excluded from the analysis**
> Example: $ bodegha repo_owner/repo_name --exclude mehdigolzadeh alexandredecan tommens --key <token>

`--only-predicted` **Only list accounts that the prediction is available**
> Example: $ bodegha repo_owner/repo_name --only-predicted
